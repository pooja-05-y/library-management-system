### Do I need to install anything?
**No!** Just open `index.html` in a browser.

### Can I customize it?
**Yes!** All code is editable. See developer path above.

### Is my data safe?
- Data stored in browser's localStorage
- Cleared if you clear browser data
- Use Export feature to backup

- ⚠️ Data stored in browser only

### For Production Use
Add these features:
1. Backend API (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
2. Real database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
